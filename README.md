# Dual-Agent Chatbot with LangGraph

A conversational AI system that intelligently routes user messages to specialized agents — a **Therapist** for emotional support or a **Logical Assistant** for analytical responses — using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and Google's Gemini model.

---

## How It Works

The graph pipeline processes each message through 4 nodes:
```
User Input → Classifier → Router → Therapist Agent
                                 ↘ Logical Agent
```

1. **Classifier Agent** — Detects whether the message is `emotional` or `logical` using structured output (Pydantic).
2. **Router Agent** — Directs the flow to the appropriate agent based on the classification.
3. **Therapist Agent** — Responds with empathy and compassion to emotional messages.
4. **Logical Agent** — Responds with clear, analytical reasoning to logical messages.

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

Then type any message at the prompt:
```
Message: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Assistant (Therapist): It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now...

Message: What is the time complexity of quicksort?
Assistant (Logical): Quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n)...

Message: exit
```

Type `exit` to quit the session.
